    <h1>Funny poem</h1>
    <p>One fine morning in the middle of a night,<br> Two dead boys got up to fight.<br>
    Back to back they faced each other,<br> Draw out the swords and shot each other.<br>
    A deaf policeman heard this noise,<br> And shot thw two dead boys.<br>
    If you don't believe my lies to be true,<br> Ask the blind man he saw it too.
