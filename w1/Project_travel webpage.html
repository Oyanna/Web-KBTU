        <p><strong>Hyde Park</strong> is a Grade I-listed major park in <em>Central London</em>. It is the largest of four <em>Royal Parks</em> that form a chain from the entrance of Kensington Palace through <em>Kensington Gardens</em> and Hyde Park, via <em>Hyde Park Corner and Green Park</em> past the main entrance to Buckingham Palace. The park is divided by the Serpentine and the Long Water lakes</p>
        <h3 class="beg">Early history</h3>
        
        <p>The park's name comes from the <em>Manor of Hyde</em>, which was the northeast sub-division of the manor of Eia (the other two sub-divisions were Ebury and Neyte) and appears as such in <em>the Domesday Book</em>.</p>
